# temperley-keyb

David Temperley's key-finding program for polyphonic music using Bayesian probabilistic modeling.
Original files and explanations may be found at http://davidtemperley.com/music-and-probability/ and downloadable here
in keyb.tar.

Modifications done by me in order to adapt the code to my compiler.

28/01/2018: The program returns the best key calculated for the first segment when the notes-beats file has less then 2 segments.
